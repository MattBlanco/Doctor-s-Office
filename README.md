# Doctor-s-Office
Simulating a Doctor's Office

Where each doctor and patient has a name and a schedule for the week. Each doctor has a specialty and each patient has a problem.
The program schedules appointments by checking if both the doctor and patient are available on that day of the week.

This project was mainly done for OOP practice, but I also wanted to try using vectors and enumerations.
